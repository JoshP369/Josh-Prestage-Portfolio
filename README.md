# Josh-Prestage-Portfolio
## Introduction
Welcome to my Portfolio Project! This repository showcases my skills and projects as a frontend web developer. This project is a culmination of the core skills I've acquired, including flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

## Project Overview
In this challenge, I built a portfolio page that serves as a dynamic representation of my work. The goal is to create an effective portfolio that highlights my strongest projects and provides insights into my thought processes behind them. A well-structured portfolio is crucial for success in the job search, and having deployed web applications enhances the overall impact.

## Features
- Navigation: The page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.

- Section Navigation: Clicking on links in the navigation scrolls the UI to the corresponding section.

- Work Section: The "My Projects" section contains titled images of my applications. The first application's image is larger than the others.

- Project Details: Clicking on project images takes the user to the deployed application for a detailed view.

- Responsive Layout: The layout adapts to various screens and devices, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience.
