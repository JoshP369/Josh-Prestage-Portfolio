## Project Overview
This repository centers around the creation of a comprehensive and responsive portfolio page to showcase my expertise as a front-end web developer. The main objective is to build a visually appealing and user-friendly portfolio that not only introduces my name and a recent photo or avatar but also offers easy navigation to sections about me, my work, and contact information. This portfolio will play a crucial role in my job search, emphasising my strongest projects and the strategies behind them.


## User Story
As a front-end web developer, I aim to construct a professional portfolio that captures the attention of potential employers. The portfolio should prominently display my name and a recent photo or avatar. Navigation links should be intuitive, directing users to sections with detailed information about me, my work, and providing a clear means of contact. Clicking on links should result in a smooth scroll to the corresponding section, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience.

In the "Work" section, titled images of my applications will be presented, with the first application's image standing out by being larger than the others, emphasizing my primary project. Clicking on these images will seamlessly redirect users to the deployed applications, allowing them to explore and interact with my work.

The portfolio layout will prioritise responsiveness, ensuring a consistent and visually pleasing presentation across diverse screens and devices. Leveraging flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables will be integral to achieving this adaptability.


## Acceptance Criteria

My portfolio will be complete when the following actions are fulfilled:

- The homepage loads with my name and a recent photo or avatar prominently displayed.

- Navigation links are be present and, when clicked, smoothly scroll to the corresponding section.

- The "Work" section contains titled images of my applications.
